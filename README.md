Options trading has become an integral part of modern finance, offering traders the ability to hedge risk or speculate on the future price movements of assets. At the heart of options trading lies the Black-Scholes model, a mathematical framework for pricing European-style options.

In this project, we delve deep into the Black-Scholes model, implementing it from scratch using Python and applying it to real-world financial data to price options with precision.

## Features

- Understanding the Black-Scholes formula and its components.
- Fetching real options data using the yfinance library.
- Implementing the Black-Scholes model in Python using an object-oriented approach.
- Visualizing option prices and Greeks with stunning plots.
- Analyzing the sensitivity of option prices to various parameters.
